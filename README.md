In this demo, I've implemented machine learning based Lithium-Ion battery capacity estimation using multi-Channel charging Profiles.<br/>

Dataset used in this example is from "Battery data set" from NASA[1].<br/>
Basic implementation theory and approach is referenced by the recent published paper[2], and they proposed Multi-Channel charging profiles
based machine learning and deep learning model. <br/>
Throught this example, we will capture each approach described in paper, including following machine/deep learning methods<br/>
- FNN(Feed Forward Network)
- CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)
- LSTM(Long Short Term Memory Network)

Dataset should be downloaded from here: https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#battery
